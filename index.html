									Dashboard</a></h2>
									<strong>Purpose</strong> <br />
									<p>The purpose of the dashboard is to provide Executive’s information about business performance. It covers an overview of quarter 4 performance in sales, COGS, profit, and units sold. It also covers sales by country, sales by product, and sales by month. The dashboard is designed to provide our Executives with a view that compares Q4 of the current year against Q4 of the previous year.   <br />

							<strong>Key Findings</strong> <br />
							<p>After analyzing the performance of Q4 we can see that we had 28.76M in sales, 25.35M in COGS, 4.41M in profit, and 263.47K in units sold. Every single one of these statistics is up from 2013 to 2014 which is a sign of good year over year growth.  <br />
							<p>In the top right-hand corner of the dashboard, we can filter the data to a specific business segment. Our government business sector is outperforming all others with 3.19M in profit and 107.39K units sold. Our Enterprise business segment is the only business segment who is losing profit year over year. I recommend a further analysis on the Enterprise business segment to try and determine what factors are causing the loss in profit.  <br />
							<p>When looking at the Q4 sales by country we can see that Canada is our top country with 7.13M in sales, 1.06M in profit, and 67.02K units sold. Mexico is our lowest performing country with only 4.61M in sales, 622.12K in profit, and 47.26K units sold. Based of this information it seems like there is an opportunity to expand our sales in the United States and Mexico. <br />
							<p>When looking at the Q4 sales by product we can see that our Paseo line has produced 1.37M in profit which is 25% of the profit recorded in Q4 of 2014. The second top product line was the Carretera which generated 946.76K in profit, followed by the VTT line which generated 645.68K in profit. It is important to note that the Velo line was the top producer in 2013 but has dropped to the 4th producer in 2014.   <br />
							<p><strong>Reccomendations</strong> <br />
							<p>All Q4 KPIs (sales, COGS, profit, and units sold) are up from 2013 to 2014 which shows good growth. The Enterprise business segment is losing profit year over year and needs to be dealt with accordingly. There is an opportunity to expand sales outside of Europe to diversify our customer base. Our top producing product line of went from Velo in 2013 to the Paseo line in 2014.  <br />

											Dashboard</a></h2>
											<strong>Purpose</strong> <br />
											<p>The purpose of the dashboard is to provide Redwood Reality Executive’s and Sale’s Managers key metrics on their performance and insights. The dashboard was created to display the total value of properties, average value of properties, and count of properties by listing status. The dashboard also illustrates the count of properties by bedroom, average property lot size by decade built, and a map of listings by zip code and listing status.    <br />

									<strong>Key Findings</strong> <br />
										<p>After analyzing the business performance dashboard, we can see that Redwood Reality currently has a total count of 33 listings, with a value of $8.44M, and has average property value of $255.88K. In the top right-hand corner of the dashboard, we can filter the data to a specific listing status.   <br />
										<p>When we analyze the dashboard with the listing status set to “For Sale,” we can see that Redwood currently has 27 properties listed for sale. The 27 properties listed for sale have a total value of $6.48M, and an average value of $239.95K. Of the 27 properties listed for sale, we can see that 21 are 3-bedroom homes, 5 are 4-bedroom homes, and only 1 is a 5-bedroom home.    <br />
										<p>When we analyze the dashboard with the listing status set to “Pending,” we can see that Redwood currently has 5 properties listed that are pending sale. The 5 properties listed pending sale have a total value of $1.58M, and an average value of $316.58K. Of the 5 properties listed for sale, we can see that 3 are 3-bedroom homes, and 2 are 4-bedroom homes.   <br />
										<p>When we analyze the dashboard with the listing status set to “Sold,” we can see that Redwood currently only has one property listed as sold. The property sold had a total value of $382.5K, had 3 bedrooms, was built in 1980, had a property lot size of 2.6K, and was located in the 80004 zip code.   <br />
										<p>Most of our listings for sale were built in the 1980s and have an average property lot size of 1.8K square feet. Out of these 9 listings, 6 of them are 3-bedroom homes, 2 of them are 4-bedroom homes, and 1 of them is a 5-bedroom home.    <br />
										</p><strong>Reccomendations</strong> <br />
									<p>Redwood Reality has only sold one property so there was not much to analyze beyond comparing the for sale and pending listings. Once more properties have been sold, we can start to analyze our sold properties against our for sale properties. This will ultimately help Redwood position the price of properties for optimal profit based on the number of bedrooms, lot size, and decade built.    <br />
